**1DCircular_Mrhogreaterthan1.ipynb**: Script for running 1-D circular stepping-stone population simulations where 1 << m*rho << L over 50 trials and outputs the allele frequency spectrum seen in Fig 6.

1DCircular_Mrhogreaterthan1.ipynb: Script for running 1-D circular stepping-stone population simulations where m*rho << 1 << L over 50 trials and outputs the allele frequency spectrum seen in Fig 5 along with the Voter Model + Wright Fisher fits

1D_Stepping_Stone.pdf: Graphic for 1-D circular stepping-stone population 

2D_Toroidal_Simulation.ipynb: Script for running 2-D toroidal stepping-stone population simulations where m*rho << 1  over 50 trials and outputs the allele frequency spectrum seen in Fig 12 along with the Wright Fisher fit. Simply change m*rho value to make it >> 1 to get Fig 11. 

Heterozygosity_Mrhogreat.ipynb: Script for calculating the mean heterozygosity for 1-D circular stepping-stone populations when 1 << m*rho << L. Outputs heteerozygosity plot seen in Fig 10. 

Heterozygosity_Mrholess.ipynb: cript for calculating the mean heterozygosity for 1-D circular stepping-stone populations when m*rho << 1 << L . Outputs heteerozygosity plot seen in Fig 9.
